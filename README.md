# Project 1: Search for data in database of organic molecules

* Search for identifier (name, InChIKey, CAS registry number) given smiles strings.
* Search for themodynamic, dielectric, transport and solvation data of organic molecules in database of experimental data of organic compounds.
* For every molecule, plot all available data and let the user select the reference data points.
